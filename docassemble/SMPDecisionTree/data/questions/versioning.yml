  Version Control
subquestion: |
  How will you manage versioning of `${ software_name }`? Which version control system will you use to manage your source code? What {versioning scheme} will you apply?

  Adequate versioning of research software facilitates management of research software, allowing for the identification of specific versions of the software.
  
  While there are typical versioning schemes that you can select in this tool, ultimately the choice of how you label your software versions is up to you, as long as other users are capable of understanding your labelling. For this reason we have included the option "Other" in the dropdown menu. If you choose that option, please indicate what your scheme looks like.
terms:
  versioning scheme: |
     Typical versioning schemes are [semver](https://semver.org/) or [calver](https://calver.org/). It is usually discouraged to use a non-standard one or invent your own.

      ### Repository
      Where do you plan to make `${ software_name }` publicly available? The most important consideration is that potential users of the software are able to get a copy they can use. This is often a public or self-hosted repository like [GitHub](https://www.github.com) or [GitLab](https://www.gitlab.com).

      Please provide links to the software if this is already the case.
    show if:
      code: public or reuse
  - no label: repository
    hint: The software will be available at https://uni_gotham.gitlab.com/RowHammer
