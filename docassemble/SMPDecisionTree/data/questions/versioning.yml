  <details>
    <summary><b>Decision Help</b></summary>
    <p>Adequate versioning of research software facilitates management of research software, allowing for the identification of specific versions of the software.</p>
  
    <p>While there are typical versioning schemes that you can select in this tool, ultimately the choice of how you label your software versions is up to you, as long as other users are capable of understanding your labelling. For this reason we have included the option "Other" in the dropdown menu. If you choose that option, please indicate what your scheme looks like.</p>
