question: |
  Reuse/Reproduce
subquestion: |
  Do you expect `${ software_name }` to be used for more than just its initial purpose, or used by external users?

  With this question, you answer if your software can be reused at a later stage or on a different project. If so, documentation needs to be provided in order to facilitate reuse.

  This question also encompasses whether the software (or suite of scripts/notebooks/data) is intended to be entirely reproducible. This is particularly relevant when the software and its outputs are integral to a peer-reviewed publication. In such instances, we recommend adding a data management plan to describe the underlying input and output data, in collaboration with your local Data Competence Center (DCC) or Publisher.
