  Reuse/Reproduce
subquestion: |
  Do you expect `${ software_name }` to be used for more than just its initial purpose, used for a long time, or have external users?

  <details>
    <summary><b>Decision Help</b></summary>
    <p>With this question, you answer if your software can be reused at a later stage or on a different project. If so, you will need to think about:
    <ul>
    <li>Who will use or contribute to ${ software_name }.</li> <!--community-->
    <li>Where people can find ${ software_name }.</li> <!--repository-->
    <li>How you will explain how to use ${ software_name }.</li> <!--documentation-->
    <li>Whether you will provide comprehensive support or training.</li> <!--support-->
    <li>Whether you will package ${ software_name } for easy distribution.</li> <!--packaging-->
    </ul></p>
    </p>

    <p>This question also encompasses whether ${ software_name } is intended to be entirely reproducible. This is particularly relevant when the software and its outputs are integral to a peer-reviewed publication. In such instances, we recommend adding a data management plan to describe the underlying input and output data, in collaboration with your local Data Competence Center (DCC) or Publisher.</p>

    <h5>Example projects that would answer “yes” here</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Scripts or software that will be reused internally in your collaboration.</li>
      <li>Software that provides a certain type of standard/common analysis given a certain type of input data (i.e. emission line measurements).</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Example projects that would answer “no” here</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>One-off code linked to a specific instrument, data, and/or publication.</li>
      <li>A custom BASH application for creating a catalog of your data during your research.</li>
    </ul>
