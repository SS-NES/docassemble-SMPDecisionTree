# When setting the `public` variable in this section, we want to recalculate the items in the navigation bar.
# In the root .yml file there is a code section that sets a dummy `navigation_recalculated` variable.
# By depending on (`depends on`) this variable here, we force it to be re-evaluated and thus re-run the navigation sections code.
# TODO This is very clunky. If there's an easier way, feel free to improve this.

  Software Access
subquestion: |
  Do you plan to make `${ software_name }` {publicly available}?
  
  If not, please provide your reasons.

  <details>
    <summary><b>Decision Help</b></summary>
    <p>If you make ${ software_name } publicly available, you will also have to think about what conditions to make ${ software_name } available under and how others will access and use it. You will need to think about:
    <ul>
    <li>Where people can find ${ software_name }.</li> <!--repository-->
    <li>How you will explain how to use ${ software_name }.</li> <!--documentation-->
    <li>What license ${ software_name } has.</li> <!--license-->
    <li>How people should refer to (cite) ${ software_name }.</li> <!--citation-->
    </ul></p>

    <p>A core belief of <a href="https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/open">open research</a> is that the primary outputs of publicly funded research results must be made publicly accessible at some point. Public funding must primarily benefit the general public. This includes research software.</p>
