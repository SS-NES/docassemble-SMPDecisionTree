    <p>If you make ${ software_name } publicly available, you will also have to think about what conditions to make ${ software_name } available under and how others will access and use it. You will need to think about:
    <ul>
    <li>Where people can find ${ software_name }.</li> <!--repository-->
    <li>How you will explain how to use ${ software_name }.</li> <!--documentation-->
    <li>What license ${ software_name } has.</li> <!--license-->
    <li>How people should refer to (cite) ${ software_name }.</li> <!--citation-->
    </ul></p>

    <p>A core belief of <a href="https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/open">open research</a> is that the primary outputs of publicly funded research results must be made publicly accessible at some point. Public funding must primarily benefit the general public. This includes research software.</p>
