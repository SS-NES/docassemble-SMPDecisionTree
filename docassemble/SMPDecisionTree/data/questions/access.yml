    <summary><b>Decision Help</b></summary>
    <p>If you make ${ software_name } publicly available, you will also have to think about what conditions to make ${ software_name } available under, e.g. its license.</p>

    <p>A core belief of <a href="https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/open">open research</a> is that the primary outputs of publicly funded research results must be made publicly accessible at some point. Public funding must primarily benefit the general public. This includes research software.</p>
