  Users, Developers, Creators
subquestion: |
  Do you expect/foresee `${ software_name }` being used by others, or integrated or modified by other developers, now or in the future?

  With this question, you answer if you expect people not directly or indirectly involved in the original development of the software to make use of it. People, in other words, that need to be taught how to deploy and use the software without being able to readily communicate with the original developer. If so, you will need to provide proper user/developer documentation, as well as follow coding best practices to facilitate deployment and use.

question: |
  Community
subquestion: |
  Does `${ software_name }` have, or do you plan to build a community around it?
  With this question, you answer if you expect a community to form around your software. With community we mean that other people from outside your direct collaborators or contacts are using or working on the software (semi-)autonomously. If so, you will need to plan for the software’s long-term sustainability and identify potential risks to its proper maintenance.
